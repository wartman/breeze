After messing around a bit: this is what we want.

```haxe
var styles = compose(
  padX(1),
  padY(2),
  hover(padX(2), padY(2))
);
```

...which should expand to something like:

```haxe
var styles = compose(
  "px-1",
  "py-2",
  compose(
    "hover:px-2",
    "hover:py-2"
  )
);
```

The idea about using functions like namespaces is a bad one -- it'll just make stuff too complicated.
