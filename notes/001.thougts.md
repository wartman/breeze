A super Tailwind inspired thing, but built around composable macro functions.

For example, here's some Tailwind:

`"pt-6 pb-6 flex items-center text-base shadow-xl"`

...and here's the equivalent in Breeze:

```haxe
style(pad(top(6), bottom(6)), flex(), itemsCenter(), text(default), shadow(Xl));
```

These functions are all macros that just output strings:

`"pad-t-6 pad-b-6 flex items-center text-default shadow-xl"`

... but which also are processed, on demand, by a macro that outputs CSS, which (for this example) should look something like:

```css
/* Stolen entirely from the tailwind example */
.pad-t-6 {
  padding-top: 1.5rem;
}
.pad-b-6 {
  padding-bottom: 9;
}
.flex {
  display: flex;
}
.items-center {
  align-items: center;
}
.text-default {
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.5rem;
}
.shadow-xl {
  --bz-shadow: 0 20px 25px -5px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 8px 10px -6px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
  --bz-shadow-colored: 0 20px 25px -5px var(--bz-shadow-color), 0 8px 10px -6px var(--bz-shadow-color);
  box-shadow: var(--bz-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000), var(--bz-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000), var(--bz-shadow);
}
```

You get the idea.

Not 100% sure how to implement this yet, but we can figure out out.

Also we can do stuff like:

```haxe
style(bg(url('/foo/bar.jpg')));
```

...which will become:

```css
.bg-SOME_HASH_HERE {
  background-image: url("/foo/bar.jpg");
}
```

> where SOME_HASH_HERE is a hash generated from "url('/foo/bar.jpg')"

This will give us a lot of flexibility without needing the bonkers syntax that Tailwind uses. We can also do stuff like:

```haxe
macro function pill(h:Expr, radius:Expr) {
  return macro Bz.style(
    Bz.pad(topAndBottom(1)),
    Bz.height($h),
    Bz.border(
      radius($radius),
      width(1),
      solid()
    )
  );
}
```

...or similar methods to compose classes.

One thing that could be cool is shown in this code from the above example:

```haxe
Bz.border(
  radius($radius),
  width(1),
  solid()
);
```

...where, basically, `Bz.border` is a macro that acts as a sort of namespace to handle all border-related code. `radius`, `solid` and `width` are not real functions -- instead, they're processed and validated by the macro function. Not sure if that's the best approach, but it could be cool (one issue: autocomplete would not work, so maybe we shouldn't).
